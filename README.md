# covid-19-EDA

### Goal
This project's purpose is to introduce people to the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and how to explore it using some foundational packages in the Scientific Python Data Science stack.

### Disclaimer
I coded along with a Live Webinar delivered by DataCamp on 2020-04-09. The project is only for practicing Python data wrangling and visualization, and it does not encourage anyone to draw conclusions from the data/visualizations at this point.
